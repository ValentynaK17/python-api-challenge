Analysis of the weather patterns to plan future vacations using [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and [Geoapify API](https://apidocs.geoapify.com/playground/places/). <br>
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator, as well as small preparation for a vacation by selecting places and appartments based on weather conditions we are interested in. <br>
**WeatherPy** directory contains *WeatherPy.ipynb* and *VacationPy.ipynb* scripts, which include the respective scripts and resulting vizualizations, as well as brief analysis summary. <br>
**output_data** directory contains the resulting csv file with cities for which weather was analyzed, as well as scatter plots showcasing relationships between Latitude and Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed respectively. <br>
## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
## Usage
Navigate to the WeatherPy directory. Be sure you have your own api_keys.py with keys for OpenWeatherMap API under weather_api_key and Geoapify API Key under geoapify_key.
Then:
 - for weather analysis: run the WeatherPy.ipynb script using Jupyter Notebook. 
 - for vacation planning: run the VacationPy.ipynb script using Jupyter Notebook. Input for Vacation planning is the list of cities (cities.csv in output_data directory) generated by WeatherPy.ipynb
